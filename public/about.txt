                Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm I'm a front-end developer who finds the journey
                from concept to application incredibly rewarding. I've always
                been fascinated by projects that tell stories, helping people
                share their stories, and create impactful experiences. Software
                development allows me to turn ideas into reality, and I enjoy
                focusing on improving my skills in the front-end world.{" "}
