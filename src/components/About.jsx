              I am a Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, and React, driven by a passion for design and
              front-end development. I have always been drawn to projects that
              tell stories and make a meaningful impact. Software development
              allows me to transform ideas into reality, and I find the entire
              process from concept to application incredibly rewarding.g. My
              goal is to bridge the gap between design and development,
              leveraging my skills to create cohesive and impactful projects.
